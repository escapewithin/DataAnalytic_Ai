## 🧭 Project Overview
A factory ships bread to different chain stores. Each unit of bread has a QR code which can be scanned and will take customer to their site and offer same unit for cheaper with same day delivery and with potential cross-sales of other white label products  on the site. We need to check which stores scan the most and which dont so we can cut costs on package printing
