Is it for high-level overview, campaign tracking, or performance analysis?\n3. **Determine Metrics:** List key performance indicators (KPIs) they want to track, such as conversion rates, website traffic, or ROI.\n\n### Step 2: Data Gathering\n1. **Identify Data Sources:** Determine where the data will come from\u2014Google Analytics, CRM systems, social media platforms, etc.\n2. **Data Availability:** Check if the required data is accessible and clean. You may need to coordinate with IT or data teams.\n\n### Step 3: Designing the Dashboard\n1. **Wireframing:** Sketch a layout of the dashboard. Prioritize important metrics at the top and consider user flow.\n2. **Choose Visualization Tools:** Decide which tools to use (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, Google Data Studio) based on complexity and user preference.\n\n### Step 4: Build the Dashboard\n1. **Connect Data Sources:** Integrate your data sources into your chosen dashboard tool.\n2. **Create Visuals:** Start building charts and graphs.
